The objective of this analysis was to understand the size distribution of wind turbines based on their capacity (t_cap). To determine the size distribution of wind turbines, the SQL query was executed in pgadmin. The results of the SQL query were imported into Tableau to create a bar chart that visualizes the distribution of wind turbine capacities.
Identify the manufacturers of wind turbines and their respective market shares. This analysis was to identify the manufacturers of wind turbines and determine the number of retrofitted turbines for each manufacturer. This was achieved by extracting relevant data using an SQL query and visualizing the results in Tableau. The bar chart highlights the leading manufacturers in terms of retrofitted turbines. It shows that manufacturers such as GE Wind, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, and Bonus have a higher number of retrofitted turbines, indicating their active involvement in upgrading and maintaining their turbines.
The results of the SQL query were imported into Tableau to create a heat map that visualizes the number of retrofitted turbines by manufacturer, along with additional data on total turbines and retrofit percentages. This heat map shows the number of turbines, retrofits, and retrofit percentages for various manufacturers. It provides a clear view of which manufacturers have the most retrofitted turbines, indicating potential maintenance needs. The project successfully addressed the three key questions through SQL data extraction and Tableau visualizations. The analysis provided insights into the size distribution of wind turbines, identified the leading manufacturers, and highlighted which manufacturers might require more maintenance based on retrofit data. These findings are valuable for stakeholders in the wind energy sector, aiding in decision-making regarding turbine purchases, maintenance strategies, and market positioning. Future analyses could include more detailed breakdowns by region, turbine model, and specific maintenance costs. Additionally, integrating more data sources could provide a comprehensive view of the factors influencing turbine performance and longevity.

Analyst #2
Determining locations and output power of turbines across the U.S. started by exploring the data sets provided in the data sprint guidelines, getting familiar with the columns and data dictionary. When looking into creating a visualization for turbine locations and output power, I focused on using values like xlong, ylat, and t_cap (output power) to make a map. First, in order to use the longitude and latitude columns, I had to convert the xlong and ylat values into geographical roles when putting them into the columns and rows. This created a map showing each individual turbine throughout the 44 states (plus Guam and Puerto Rico). Once the turbine locations were made, I used the t_cap value to visualize output power by size and color based on the output capacity range from 50 – 6000 kilowatts (kW). This allowed the turbine locations to be more differentiated by having lower capacity turbines being smaller and colored red while higher capacity turbines were bigger and colored green. Finally, for our map we wanted to animate the turbine locations as the number of years passed using p_year (year turbine became operational and began providing power). P_year was put into the pages card and edited to make the map become cumulative of the turbine locations from 1981-2021.

A separate map visualization was also made showing the onshore and offshore wind turbines in America. This was done by taking the map made from my work mentioned above and removing the details of color and size based on the output power. A filter was placed from the EIA dataset using the “Reported Prime Mover” value, which showed the onshore and offshore turbines. Once the map was finished, it showed only one area where offshore wind turbines were installed. Specifically, 5 offshore turbines off the coast of Rhode Island. 

The next task was focusing on wind turbines and comparing it to population data. At first, I was struggling to find any population data that could be used from the datasets provided to us. I ultimately ended up using the data layers in Tableau to find the population size of 2018. This was further specified by looking at population sizes of counties in all states in America. Was able to overlay the wind turbine locations used in work on locations and power of turbines and show which areas are more abundant in turbine quantity. 

Analyzing average wind speeds overlaid on a map of all wind turbines in the U.S. to show potential opportunities was a last-minute addition of a task we were unsure of adding. However, wind speed maps were made available showing the surface levels of 30 and 60 meters. This allowed me to import images of the wind maps into Tableau and make a dashboard showing the two maps with the turbine locations placed. This allowed further insight towards why the center of the U.S. had more turbines installed by showing the greater wind speeds available in states like Texas, Kansas, and Iowa. It also shows why certain states have no turbines installed from 1981-2021 such as Alabama and Georgia, having the lowest annual wind speeds (<4.0 meters/second).  

For remaining items related to holistic analysis I was able to answer the question about number of onshore vs offshore turbines from work I had already done. Next task was to research about the profitability of the wind industry. I was able to find several sources through external research but had difficulties finding the exact information needed to answer the question efficiently. All the resources and comments regarding their information were stored in the Trello dashboard in the comments.
